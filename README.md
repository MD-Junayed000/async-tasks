# Async Task Processing System with AWS Deployment

This project demonstrates a production-ready asynchronous task processing system (i.e Deployed in EC2 using Pulumi explained in infra-branch) using: 

 **Flask** as (Web + API), **Celery** as (Task Queue Executor) , **RabbitMQ** as (Message Broker) , **Redis** as (Result Backend) , **Flower** as (Monitoring UI) , **Docker** as (Multi-service orchestration)


## Project Overview

This project is divided into 3 Labs, each Lab shows various implementation with techonology tools:

- **Lab-1-Async-Tasks**: System Design in Local machine and Poridhi lab implementation ([Read more](README.md))
- **Lab-2-Single-Instance**: Pulumi-Driven AWS Deployment steps (single EC2 instance) ([Read more](https://github.com/MD-Junayed000/async-tasks/blob/main/Lab-2-Single-Instance/README.md))
- **Lab-3-Multi-EC2**: Multi-EC2 instance deployment ([Read more](https://github.com/MD-Junayed000/async-tasks/blob/main/Lab-3-Multi-EC2/README.md))




>  **Objective**: Design a system that allows users to submit tasks asynchronously from a Flask API, execute them reliably in the background using Celery, queue tasks in RabbitMQ, and store task states and results in a backend db (redis).

##  System Architecture :
<img src="assets/Try-Page.svg" alt="Implementation Diagram" width="1000">

***1. User Request via API :***
 user interacts with the frontend UI to trigger a task—such as sending an email, reversing a text, or analyzing sentiment. This action sends an HTTP request to the Flask backend through a specific API endpoint.

***2.  Flask App: Receiving & Dispatching***
 Receives request and pushes task to Celery using delay().Flask responds to the user immediately with a confirmation message and a task_id, ensuring the experience remains fast and non-blocking.


***3. Celery as the Producer***
When .delay() is called, Celery acts as a task producer—serializing the task and sending it to the RabbitMQ message broker.

***4. RabbitMQ: Message Broker Layer***
RabbitMQ receives the serialized task and places it in a queue (commonly named celery_see).plays the role of a message router, managing queues and delivering tasks to any available consumer (Celery workers). It ensures decoupling between producers (Flask) and consumers (workers), allowing each part to scale independently.In these case:

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/queue.svg" alt="Broker Diagram" width="700">
</div>

* Consumer = Celery Worker

* Exchange = Implicit direct exchange

* Queue = celery_see (task queue)


***5. Celery Workers: Task Execution Engine***

Celery workers continuously listen for tasks on the RabbitMQ queue. When a task becomes available, a worker pulls it, executes the defined function (like sending an email or reversing a string), and processes it in the background. With --concurrency enabled, workers can process multiple tasks in parallel, significantly improving throughput and responsiveness.



***6. Redis: Result Tracking Backend***

After a worker finishes processing a task, it stores the result and status (SUCCESS, FAILURE, or RETRY) in Redis. Redis serves as a fast, in-memory database that holds the task metadata under unique keys tied to the task_id. Flask can later query Redis using AsyncResult(task_id) to retrieve this data and update the user.

***7. UI Feedback:***

Finally, the frontend periodically polls the backend using the task_id to check the task’s status. Once Redis indicates that the task is complete, Flask fetches the result and returns it to the UI. The user sees a confirmation message or the processed output (e.g., reversed string or sentiment result). This feedback loop ensures the user is kept informed without blocking the main thread.

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repo and Navigate

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MD-Junayed000/async-tasks.git
cd async-tasks
cd Lab-1-Async-Tasks/Async-tasks
```

### 2️⃣ Start Services via Docker

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```



## 🌐 URLs & Ports

| Service        | URL                                              |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |

| RabbitMQ Admin | [http://localhost:15672](http://localhost:15672) |
| Flower Monitor | [http://localhost:5555](http://localhost:5555)   |



## Available Tasks

<div align="center">

| Task Type        | Description                           |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Send Email**   | Simulates sending an email (w/ retry) |
| **Reverse Text** | Reverses any string                   |
| **Sentiment**    | Fake sentiment analysis on input text |

</div>

Each task returns a `Task ID` and status message ✅/❌.

## Poridhi Lab Setup
1. Access the application through load balancer:
At first we load the system following the instructions as in local machine and checking if all the ports are forwarded![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e400c90-6b9e-4787-8416-12f10e29657c)



2. Configure IP and port:
- Get IP from eth0 using `ifconfig`

</div>

- Use application port from Dockerfile



3. Create load balancer and configure with your application's IP and port in Poridhi lab:

## Appication
### API Endpoints
**Submit a Task:** Submit any sorts of task like Email,Reverse text proessing,Sentiment analysis if text contain 'good'keywords.If 'fail' keyword in email receipent,it will raise error and will retry max 3 times then discarded.
Domain name for a load balancer in the Poridhi lab environment (For 5000 port):https://67aa3ccddb2c69e7e975ceff-lb-803.bm-southeast.lab.poridhi.io/

###  Task Monitoring with Flower

 Open the load balancer for port 5555 in the poridhi lab environment:https://67aa3ccddb2c69e7e975ceff-lb-751.bm-southeast.lab.poridhi.io/tasks

  ![Screenshot 2025-06-03 192629](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2dbf9954-abf7-4611-af9f-8e9be87efc2b)

* View task history, retries, failures
* Inspect live workers and system load

### RabbitMQ Management UI
Default credentials: guest/guest
-Monitor queues, exchanges, and connections

### Error Handling & Retries
>Email task uses self.retry() with max_retries=3

>If task fails, it's requeued

>Redis tracks the task state:

* PENDING, SUCCESS, RETRY, FAILURE
![Screenshot 2025-06-03 192859](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c33a9312-de04-4305-b0d6-40a9be625430)


> inspect it using:

```bash
docker exec -it async-tasks-redis-1 redis-cli
> KEYS *
> GET celery-task-meta-xxxxxxx
```


###  Use Postman for Submissions

Example JSON for email:

```json
{
  "form_type": "email",
  "recipient": "someone@example.com",
  "subject": "Greetings",
  "body": "Hello from Flask"
}
```

## ⚠️ Common Issues & Fixes

| Problem                 | Fix                                    |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Task not completing     | Check RabbitMQ & Celery logs           |
| Task stuck in `PENDING` | Check Redis config or broker queue     |
| No Redis output         | Use `AsyncResult().get()` or API fetch |
| UI not showing output   | Ensure sessions are set up correctly   |




##  Concepts Implemented

* Direct exchange with `celery_see` queue
* Multi-worker concurrency with `--concurrency=4`
* Flask session flash for notifications
